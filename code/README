Homework 4

	To execute provided input with pigs, please execute "./pigtest.sh"
	To execute provided input with cells, please execute "./celltest.sh"

	Execute program with following command:

		./sharpen <IMAGE_FILENAME> <CLUSTERING_THRESHOLD> <USE_NEGATIVE> <N_GRADIENTS> <M_OC_GRADIENTS> <K_ITERATIONS>

		Required program options must be specified,
		specifying optional parameters requires all preceding options are specified in order

		Explanations for each option:

			IMAGE_FILENAME			(required)
				Name of input image file to display

			CLUSTERING_THRESHOLD	(optional in range 0->1, defaults 0.025)
				Specifies a required percentage for a clustered item to count.
				Generated data clusters for objects smaller than this percentage
				of the image will be discarded as noise.  May be tweaked to better
				focus on larger objects rather than smaller in image.

			USE_NEGATIVE			(optional 0/1 value, defaults 0)
				Images will process by default with lighter shades considered as objects
				and darker shades considered background.  To invert this use negative of
				image for processing by setting to 1.

			N_GRADIENTS				(optional 0 or larger, defaults 0)
				Image processing loop will calculate gradient N times,
				subtracting the current morph gradient from the image.

			M_OP_ERODES			(optional 0 or larger, defaults 0)
				Image processing loop will calculate the erosion of the opening of the image,
				Program will perform this M times.

			K_ITERATIONS			(optional 0 or larger, defaults 1)
				Program will calulate N morph gradient removals and M eroded openings each
				time removing the gradient from the image, these N + M transactions will
				be performed K times. 

	Runtime Instructions:

		Upon Starting program, all images are generated and number of clusters is counted and
		displayed in invoking terminal.  Pressing spacebar will cycle the displayed image and
		the current displayed image will be stated in the terminal.  Exit program by pressing
		escape key while image panel is has focus.

	Algorithm Description:

		The program will calculate the erosion of the opening of the original image minus its
		morphological gradient, and then will repeat this process a user specified number of times.

		Subtracting the morphological gradient from the original image will result in an image
		with embellished borders between objects.  Following this, the erosion of the opening will
		result in defined but receded object borders.  Repeating this a number of times will better
		distinguish objects, but will break down objects if done too much.

		Lastly, a DBScan-like clustering algorithm will be performed for organizing object structures
		and counting them across the image.  During this phase, the tree of each object's connected
		pixels will be recolored for navigation and displayed.
		
		The structuring element for all operations is as depicted below:

			[ 0,  2,  0 ]
			[ 2,  8,  2 ]
			[ 0,  2,  0 ]
