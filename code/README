Homework 4

	Execute program with following command:

		./sharpen <IMAGE_FILENAME> <CLUSTERING_THRESHOLD> <USE_NEGATIVE> <USE_BINARY>

		Required program options must be specified,
		specifying optional parameters requires all preceding options are specified in order

		Explanations for each option:

			IMAGE_FILENAME			(required)
				Name of input image file to display

			CLUSTERING_THRESHOLD	(optional in range 0->1, defaults 0.025)
				Specifies a required percentage for a clustered item to count.
				Generated data clusters for objects smaller than this percentage
				of the image will be discarded as noise.  May be tweaked to better
				focus on larger objects rather than smaller in image.

			USE_NEGATIVE			(optional 0/1 value, defaults 0)
				Images will process by default with lighter shades considered as objects
				and darker shades considered background.  To invert this use negative of
				image for processing by setting to 1.

			USE_BINARY				(optional 0/1 value, defaults 0)
				Defunct, Flag no longer used

	Runtime Instructions:

		Upon Starting program, all images are generated and number of clusters is counted and
		displayed in invoking terminal.  Pressing spacebar will cycle the displayed image and
		the current displayed image will be stated in the terminal.  Exit program by pressing
		escape key while image panel is has focus.

	Algorithm Description:

		The program will calculate the erosion of the opening of the original image minus its
		morphological gradient, and then will repeat this process precisely once more on the resultant
		image.  Subtracting the morphological gradient from the original image will result in an image
		with embellished borders between objects.  Following this, the erosion of the opening will
		result in defined but receded object borders.  Performing these operations twice will yield
		decently receded borders for pessimistic processing.  Lastly, DBScan-like clustering will be
		performed for organizing object structures and counting them across the image.  During this phase,
		the tree of each objects connected pixels will be recolored for navigation and displayed.
		
		The structuring element for all operations is as depicted below:

			[ 0,  2,  0 ]
			[ 2,  8,  2 ]
			[ 0,  2,  0 ]
